# Access "Blocks" features from Python on Mindstorms Robot Inventor

## About

This repository will include information that I have managed to pull together about the Mindstorms Robot Inventor hub.  It is possible that some or all of this will work on the SPIKE hub, but I am not able to test that.

Using the code and features here will **not** require any changes to your hub firmware!

## Extracting files from the hub

In order to discover how to use more of the functionality of the Mindstorms hub, we need to be able to access the files on it.  Information on how to do that is in the [extracting](extracting) directory.
